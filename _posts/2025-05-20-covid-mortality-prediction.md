description: This project focuses on the development of simplified risk tool that enables rapid triaging of SARS CoV-2 positive patients during hospital admission, which complements current practice. Many predictive tools developed to date are complex, rely on multiple blood results and past medical history, do not include chest X ray results and rely on Artificial Intelligence rather than simplified algorithms. Our aim was to develop a simplified risk-tool based on five parameters and CXR image data that predicts the 60-day survival of adult SARS CoV-2 positive patients at hospital admission.

> Clinical prediction models such as NEWS2 is currently used in practice as mortality risk assessment. In a rapid response to support COVID-19 patient assessment and resource management, published risk tools and models have been found to have a high risk of bias and therefore cannot be translated into clinical practice.

## Goal 


We have developed and validated risk tool (LUCAS) based on rapid and routine blood tests predicts the mortality of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus. This prediction model has both high and robust predictive power and has been tested on an external set of patients and therefore can be used to effectively triage patients when resources are limited. In addition, LUCAS can be used with chest imaging information and NEWS2 score.
