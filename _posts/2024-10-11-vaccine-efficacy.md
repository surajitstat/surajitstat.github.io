description: Vaccines based on the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 are a cornerstone of the public health response to COVID-19. The emergence of hypermutated, increasingly transmissible variants of concern (VOCs) threaten this strategy. We study the real-world vaccine effectiveness of Oxford/AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1), Pfizer BioNTech (BNT162b2)  and Moderna (mRNA-1273). that was partially restored along with the effectiveness of  booster vaccination.

We have led the statistical analyses of one of the earliest study of vaccine effectiveness  against Omicron SARS-CoV-2 infection in the recent Nature Microbiology paper “SARS-CoV-2 Omicron is an immune escape variant with an altered cell entry pathway”, along with Dr. Oscar MacLean of the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research. The results showed that Omicron had a greater ability to evade the effects of vaccination, but that there were protective effects of previous infection and third (booster) vaccine doses. The findings of the paper were presented at Scotland- and UK-wide meetings by Prof. Emma Thomson, who is a member of the Standing Committee on Pandemic Preparedness (ScotGov)  and Variant Technical Group members (UKHSA)  which fed into NHSScotland and UK-wide government decision-making processes.

## Current Projects

 - Vaccine effectiveness against Omicron in adult population across Greater Glasgow Health Board (NHSGGC). 
 - Vaccine effectiveness in pediatric population across Scotland.  
 - Severity across successive SARS-CoV-2 variants measured in terms of Death, ICU admission and Hospitalisation.   [Preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.24.22272915v2)
 
 - Adeno-associated virus 2 infection in children with non-A-E hepatitis. [Preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.19.22277425v1)
 - Analysis data arising from next generation sequencing (e.g. PhIP-Seq characterization of serum antibodies) to detect new and emerging viruses.
