> The primary goal for developing the new statistical framework is to mimic the human perception for tumour delineation and marry it with all the advantages of an analytic method using modern-day computing environment. Our proposed framework will explicitly use statistical models which can accommodate the 2D and 3D spatial relationships in medical images along with their natural ability to fuse images from different modalities (e.g. CT/MRI) and provide complementary information for image segmentation tasks. This project has six main aims:
