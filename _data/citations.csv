It is shown that their topography, in the sense of their key features as a density, can be analyzed rigorously in lower dimensions by use of a ridgeline manifold that contains all critical points, as well as the ridges of the density. A plot of the elevations on the ridgeline shows the key features of the mixed density. In addition, by use of the ridgeline, we uncover a function that determines the number of modes of the mixed density when there are two components being mixed. A followup analysis then gives a curvature function that can be used to prove a set of modality theorems.

A cluster is formed by those sample points that ascend to the same local maximum (mode) of the density function. The path from a point to its associated mode is efficiently solved by an EM-style algorithm, namely, the Modal EM (MEM). This method is then extended for hierarchical clustering by recursively locating modes of kernel density estimators with increasing bandwidths. Without model fitting, the mode-based clustering yields a density description for every cluster, a major advantage of mixture-model-based clustering. Moreover, it ensures that every cluster corresponds to a bump of the density. The issue of diagnosing clustering results is also investigated. Specifically, a pairwise separability measure for clusters is defined using the ridgeline between the density bumps of two clusters. The ridgeline is solved for by the Ridgeline EM (REM) algorithm, an extension of MEM. Based upon this new measure, a cluster merging procedure is created to enforce strong separation. Experiments on simulated and real data demonstrate that the mode-based clustering approach tends to combine the strengths of linkage and mixture-model-based clustering. In addition, the approach is robust in high dimensions and when clusters deviate substantially from Gaussian distributions. Both of these cases pose difficulty for parametric mixture modeling.

A key step in the development of an adaptive immune response to pathogens or vaccines is the binding of short peptides to molecules of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) for presentation to T lymphocytes, which are thereby activated and differentiate into effector and memory cells. The rational design of vaccines consists in part in the identification of appropriate peptides to effect this process. There are several algorithms currently in use for making such predictions, but these are limited to a small number of MHC molecules and have good but imperfect prediction power. Results. We have undertaken an exploration of the power gained by taking advantage of a natural representation of the amino acids in terms of their biophysical properties. We used several well-known statistical classifiers using either a naive encoding of amino acids by name or an encoding by biophysical properties. In all cases, the encoding by biophysical properties leads to substantially lower misclassification error. Conclusion. Representation of amino acids using a few important bio-physio-chemical property provide a natural basis for representing peptides and greatly improves peptide-MHC class I binding prediction.  2007 Ray and Kepler; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,,"Ray, S.; Department of Mathematics and Statistics, , Boston, MA, United States; email: sray@math.bu.edu",NA,,17457580,,,NA,English,Immunome Res.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-38049150954,"Ray S., Kepler T.B.",,,6fdf5328ea065c846e25bdd8d74de1558574fe5d,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6fdf5328ea065c846e25bdd8d74de1558574fe5d,2007,NA

To the extent that this technology produces clinically acceptable segmentations for a significant fraction of cases, there is a risk that the clinician will assume every result is acceptable. In the less frequent case where segmentation fails, we are concerned that unless the user is alerted by the computer, she would still put the result to clinical use. By alerting the user to the location of a likely segmentation failure, we allow her to apply limited validation and editing resources where they are most needed. We propose an automated method to signal suspected non-credible regions of the segmentation, triggered by statistical outliers of the local image match function. We apply this test to m-rep segmentations of the bladder and prostate in CT images using a local image match computed by PCA on regional intensity quantile functions. We validate these results by correlating the non-credible regions with regions that have surface distance greater than 5.5mm to a reference segmentation for the bladder. A 6mm surface distance was used to validate the prostate results. Varying the outlier threshold level produced a receiver operating characteristic with area under the curve of 0.89 for the bladder and 0.92 for the prostate. Based on this preliminary result, our method has been able to predict local segmentation failures and shows potential for validation in an automatic segmentation pipeline.",Validation,Computerized tomography; Image matching; Medical imaging; Statistical methods; Automatic segmentation pipeline; Local image match functions; Segmentation failure; Statistical outliers; Image segmentation,"Levy, J.H.; Department of Computer Science, , Chapel Hill, NC, United States; email: levy@cs.unc.edu",NA,,16057422,0819466301; 9780819466303,,NA,English,Progr.

A number of prediction servers are available for identification of peptides that bind major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules. The lack of standardized methodology and large number of human MHC-I molecules make the selection of appropriate prediction servers difficult. This study reports a comparative evaluation of thirty prediction servers for seven human MHC-I molecules. Results: Of 147 individual predictors 39 have shown excellent, 47 good, 33 marginal, and 28 poor ability to classify binders from non-binders. The classifiers for HLA-A*0201, A*0301, A*1101, B*0702, B*0801, and B*1501 have excellent, and for A*2402 moderate classification accuracy. Sixteen prediction servers predict peptide binding affinity to MHC-I molecules with high accuracy; correlation coefficients ranging from r = 0.55 (B*0801) to r = 0.87 (A*0201). Conclusion: Non-linear predictors outperform matrix-based predictors. Most predictors can be improved by non-linear transformations of their raw prediction scores. The best predictors of peptide binding are also best in prediction of T-cell epitopes. We propose a new standard for MHC-I binding prediction - a common scale for normalization of prediction scores, applicable to both experimental and predicted data. The results of this study provide assistance to researchers in selection of most adequate prediction tools and selection criteria that suit the needs of their projects.  2008 Lin et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"epitope; HLA A antigen; major histocompatibility antigen class 1; vaccine; epitope; HLA antigen class 1; peptide; accuracy; amino acid sequence; antigen presentation; article; binding affinity; classification algorithm; clinical assessment tool; clinical research; computer model; computer program; controlled study; correlation coefficient; data base; human; information technology; intermethod comparison; peptide analysis; prediction; protein binding; scale up; scoring system; standardization; T lymphocyte; animal; biology; immunology; Internet; protein binding; protein database; standard; Animals; Computational Biology; Databases, Protein; Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte; Histocompatibility Antigens Class I; Humans; Internet; Peptides; Protein Binding; Vaccines","Brusic, V.; Cancer Vaccine Center, , Boston, MA, United States; email: Vladimir_Brusic@dfci.harvard.edu",NA,,14712172,,BIMMC,18366636,English,BMC Immunol.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-42549105195,"Lin H.H., Ray S., Tongchusak S., Reinherz E.L., Brusic V.",,,ba7f13aba9a53a01d21d455534026e759a61452f,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ba7f13aba9a53a01d21d455534026e759a61452f,2008,NA

The loss function is defined as the generalized quadratic distance between the true density and the model proposed. These distances are characterized by a simple quadratic form structure that is adaptable through the choice of a non-negative definite kernel and a bandwidth parameter. Using asymptotic results for the quadratic distances we build a quick-to-compute approximation for the risk function. Its derivation is analogous to the Akaike information criterion but, unlike the Akaike information criterion, the quadratic risk is a global comparison tool. The method does not require resampling, which is a great advantage when point estimators are expensive to compute. The method is illustrated by using the problem of selecting the number of components in a mixture model, where it is shown that, by using an appropriate kernel, the method is computationally straightforward in arbitrarily high data dimensions. In this same context it is shown that the method has some clear advantages over the Akaike information criterion and Bayesian information criterion.  2008 Royal Statistical Society.",Global comparison of models; High dimensional data; Mixture models; Model selection; Quadratic distance; Quadratic risk; Spectral degrees of freedom,,"Ray, S.; Department of Mathematics and Statistics, 111 Cummington Street, Boston, MA 02215, United States; email: sray@math.bu.edu",NA,,13697412,,,NA,English,J.

It owes its success in many cancer microarray datasets to an effective feature selection algorithm that is based on relative expression ordering of gene pairs. However, its general robustness does not extend to some difficult datasets, such as those involving cancer outcome prediction, which may be due to the relatively simple voting scheme used by the classifier. We believe that the performance can be enhanced by separating its effective feature selection component and combining it with a powerful classifier such as the support vector machine (SVM). More generally the top scoring pairs generated by the k-TSP ranking algorithm can be used as a dimensionally reduced subspace for other machine learning classifiers.Results: We developed an approach integrating the k-TSP ranking algorithm (TSP) with other machine learning methods, allowing combination of the computationally efficient, multivariate feature ranking of k-TSP with multivariate classifiers such as SVM. We evaluated this hybrid scheme (k-TSP+SVM) in a range of simulated datasets with known data structures. As compared with other feature selection methods, such as a univariate method similar to Fisher's discriminant criterion (Fisher), or a recursive feature elimination embedded in SVM (RFE), TSP is increasingly more effective than the other two methods as the informative genes become progressively more correlated, which is demonstrated both in terms of the classification performance and the ability to recover true informative genes. We also applied this hybrid scheme to four cancer prognosis datasets, in which k-TSP+SVM outperforms k-TSP classifier in all datasets, and achieves either comparable or superior performance to that using SVM alone. In concurrence with what is observed in simulation, TSP appears to be a better feature selector than Fisher and RFE in some of the cancer datasets. Conclusions: The k-TSP ranking algorithm can be used as a computationally efficient, multivariate filter method for feature selection in machine learning. SVM in combination with k-TSP ranking algorithm outperforms k-TSP and SVM alone in simulated datasets and in some cancer prognosis datasets. Simulation studies suggest that as a feature selector, it is better tuned to certain data characteristics, i.e. correlations among informative genes, which is potentially interesting as an alternative feature ranking method in pathway analysis.  2011 Shi et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Classification performance; Computationally efficient; Feature selection algorithm; Feature selection methods; Fisher's discriminant; Machine learning methods; Microarray data sets; Recursive feature elimination; Algorithms; Computational efficiency; Diseases; Feature extraction; Gene expression; Support vector machines; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; computer program; genetics; human; metabolism; neoplasm; prognosis; support vector machine; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Humans; Neoplasms; Prognosis; Software; Support Vector Machines,"Shi, P.; Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare Institute, 133 Brookline Ave, Boston, MA 02215, United States; email: pscshi@gmail.com",NA,,14712105,,BBMIC,21939564,English,BMC Bioinform.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053173508,"Shi P., Ray S., Zhu Q., Kon M.A.",,,c2e29046cfe5f5c6a3850828ca96b1ba62eff270,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c2e29046cfe5f5c6a3850828ca96b1ba62eff270,2011,NA

However, computational limitations or lack of an appropriate prior sometimes prevent researchers from using exact BFs. Instead, it is approximated, often using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) or a variant of BIC. The authors provide a comparison of several BF approximations, including two new approximations, the Scaled Unit Information Prior Bayesian Information Criterion (SPBIC) and Information matrix-based Bayesian Information Criterion (IBIC). The SPBIC uses a scaled unit information prior that is more general than the BIC's unit information prior, and the IBIC utilizes more terms of approximation than the BIC. Through simulation, the authors show that several measures perform well in large samples, that performance declines in smaller samples, and that SPBIC and IBIC provide improvement to existing measures under some conditions, including small sample sizes. The authors illustrate the use of the fit measures with the crime data of Ehrlich and then conclude with recommendations for researchers.

However, while designing such applications, little or no attention has been paid to the human perspective that is absolutely central to the manual gating process of identifying and characterizing cell populations. In particular, the assumption of many common techniques that cell populations could be modeled reliably with pre-specified distributions may not hold true in real-life samples, which can have populations of arbitrary shapes and considerable inter-sample variation. Results: To address this, we developed a new framework flowScape for emulating certain key aspects of the human perspective in analyzing flow data, which we implemented in multiple steps. First, flowScape begins with creating a mathematically rigorous map of the high-dimensional flow data landscape based on dense and sparse regions defined by relative concentrations of events around modes. In the second step, these modal clusters are connected with a global hierarchical structure. This representation allows flowScape to perform ridgeline analysis for both traversing the landscape and isolating cell populations at different levels of resolution. Finally, we extended manual gating with a new capacity for constructing templates that can identify target populations in terms of their relative parameters, as opposed to the more commonly used absolute or physical parameters. This allows flowScape to apply such templates in batch mode for detecting the corresponding populations in a flexible, sample-specific manner. We also demonstrated different applications of our framework to flow data analysis and show its superiority over other analytical methods. Conclusions: The human perspective, built on top of intuition and experience, is a very important component of flow cytometric data analysis. By emulating some of its approaches and extending these with automation and rigor, flowScape provides a flexible and robust framework for computational cytomics.  2012 Ray, Pyne.",,article; batch process; cell isolation; cell population; cluster analysis; concentration process; conceptual framework; controlled study; data analysis; data analysis software; flow cytometry; intermethod comparison; mathematical computing; optical resolution; physical parameters; process development; algorithm; biology; human; methodology; reproducibility; Algorithms; Computational Biology; Flow Cytometry; Humans; Reproducibility of Results,"Ray, S.; Department of Mathematics and Statistics, , Boston, MA, United States; email: sray@math.bu.edu",NA,,19326203,,,22563466,English,PLoS ONE,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860476264,"Ray S., Pyne S.",,,c9bfe5a7c1e15803f38b0001cc6c8e19da22f4db,NA,NA,NA

Multivariate mixture models are widely used for modeling homogeneous populations and for cluster analysis. Either the components directly or modes arising from these components are often used to extract individual clusters. Although in lower dimensions these strategies work well, our results show that high dimensional mixtures are often very complex and researchers should take extra precautions when using mixture models for cluster analysis. Further our analysis shows that the number of modes depends on the component means and eigenvalues of the ratio of the two component covariance matrices, which in turn provides a clear guideline as to when one can use mixture analysis for clustering high dimensional data.  2012 Elsevier Inc.",Clustering; Dimension reduction; Manifold; Mixture; Modal cluster; Multivariate mode; Primary; Secondary; Topography,,"Ray, S.; Department of Mathematics and Statistics, 111 Cummington Street, Boston, MA 02215, United States; email: sray@bu.edu",NA,,0047259X,,JMVAA,NA,English,J.

In practice, a group sequential design (GSD) method is used to stop trials early for promising efficacy, and conditional power (CP) is used for futility stopping rules. In this article, we show that stopping boundaries for the GSD with multiple co-primary endpoints should be the same as those for studies with single endpoints. Lan and Wittes proposed the B-value tool to calculate the CP of single endpoint trials and we extend this tool to calculate the CP for studies with multiple co-primary endpoints. We consider the cases of two-arm studies with co-primary normal and provide an example of implementation with simulated trial.

We propose a parametric model for spatial correlation and the between-curve correlation is modeled by correlating functional principal component scores of the functional data. Additionally, in the sparse observation framework, we propose a novel approach of spatial principal analysis by conditional expectation to explicitly estimate spatial correlations and reconstruct individual curves. Assuming spatial stationarity, empirical spatial correlations are calculated as the ratio of eigenvalues of the smoothed covariance surface Cov(Xi(s) , Xi(t)) and cross-covariance surface Cov(Xi(s) , Xj(t)) at locations indexed by i and j. Then a anisotropy Matrn spatial correlation model is fitted to empirical correlations. Finally, principal component scores are estimated to reconstruct the sparsely observed curves. This framework can naturally accommodate arbitrary covariance structures, but there is an enormous reduction in computation if one can assume the separability of temporal and spatial components. We demonstrate the consistency of our estimates and propose hypothesis tests to examine the separability as well as the isotropy effect of spatial correlation. Using simulation studies, we show that these methods have some clear advantages over existing methods of curve reconstruction and estimation of model parameters.  2016, The Author(s).",Conditioning; consistency; Functional data analysis; Principal components; Smoothing; Spatial correlation,,"Ray, S.; School of Mathematics and Statistics, United Kingdom; email: surajit.ray@glasgow.ac.uk",NA,Springer New York LLC,9603174,,,NA,English,Stat.

They are significant stocks of global soil carbon, and therefore predicting the depth of peatlands is an important part of establishing an accurate assessment of their magnitude. Yet there have been few attempts to account for both internal and external processes when predicting the depth of peatlands. Using blanket peatlands in Great Britain as a case study, we compare a linear and geostatistical (spatial) model and several sets of covariates applicable for peatlands around the world that have developed over hilly or undulating terrain. We hypothesized that the spatial model would act as a proxy for the autogenic processes in peatlands that can mediate the accumulation of peat on plateaus or shallow slopes. Our findings show that the spatial model performs better than the linear model in all casesroot mean square errors (RMSE) are lower, and 95% prediction intervals are narrower. In support of our hypothesis, the spatial model also better predicts the deeper areas of peat, and we show that its predictive performance in areas of deep peat is dependent on depth observations being spatially autocorrelated. Where they are not, the spatial model performs only slightly better than the linear model. As a result, we recommend that practitioners carrying out depth surveys fully account for the variation of topographic features in prediction locations, and that sampling approach adopted enables observations to be spatially autocorrelated.  2018 Young et al.

Early symptoms overlap with other common conditions such as common cold and Influenza, making early screening and diagnosis are crucial goals for health practitioners. The aim of the study was to use machine learning (ML), an artificial neural network (ANN) and a simple statistical test to identify SARS-CoV-2 positive patients from full blood counts without knowledge of symptoms or history of the individuals. The dataset included in the analysis and training contains anonymized full blood counts results from patients seen at the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, at So Paulo, Brazil, and who had samples collected to perform the SARS-CoV-2 rt-PCR test during a visit to the hospital. Patient data was anonymised by the hospital, clinical data was standardized to have a mean of zero and a unit standard deviation. This data was made public with the aim to allow researchers to develop ways to enable the hospital to rapidly predict and potentially identify SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. We find that with full blood counts random forest, shallow learning and a flexible ANN model predict SARS-CoV-2 patients with high accuracy between populations on regular wards (AUC = 9495%) and those not admitted to hospital or in the community (AUC = 8086%). Here, AUC is the Area Under the receiver operating characteristics Curve and a measure for model performance. Moreover, a simple linear combination of 4 blood counts can be used to have an AUC of 85% for patients within the community. The normalised data of different blood parameters from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients exhibit a decrease in platelets, leukocytes, eosinophils, basophils and lymphocytes, and an increase in monocytes. SARS-CoV-2 positive patients exhibit a characteristic immune response profile pattern and changes in different parameters measured in the full blood count that are detected from simple and rapid blood tests. While symptoms at an early stage of infection are known to overlap with other common conditions, parameters of the full blood counts can be analysed to distinguish the viral type at an earlier stage than current rt-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 allow at present. This new methodology has potential to greatly improve initial screening for patients where PCR based diagnostic tools are limited.  2020 The Authors",Artificial Neural Network (ANN); Full blood count; Leukocytes; Machine Learning; Monocytes; SARS-CoV-2; Screening,"adult; article; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; basophil; blood cell count; Brazil; case report; clinical article; eosinophil; female; human; immune response; lymphocyte; machine learning; male; monocyte; nonhuman; patient coding; polymerase chain reaction; random forest; receiver operating characteristic; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; thrombocyte; virus typing; Betacoronavirus; blood; Coronavirus infection; immunology; information processing; laboratory technique; machine learning; mass screening; pandemic; procedures; prognosis; statistical model; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Blood Cell Count; Brazil; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Datasets as Topic; Humans; Machine Learning; Mass Screening; Models, Statistical; Neural Networks, Computer; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prognosis; ROC Curve","Mackenzie, L.S.; School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, United Kingdom; email: l.mackenzie2@brighton.ac.uk",NA,Elsevier B.V.,15675769,,IINMB,32652499,English,Int.

As COVID-19 can cause severe pneumonia, early diagnosis is essential for correct treatment, as well as to reduce the stress on the healthcare system. Along with COVID-19, other etiologies of pneumonia and Tuberculosis (TB) constitute additional challenges to the medical system. Pneumonia (viral as well as bacterial) kills about 2 million infants every year and is consistently estimated as one of the most important factor of childhood mortality (according to the World Health Organization). Chest X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scans are the primary imaging modalities for diagnosing respiratory diseases. Although CT scans are the gold standard, they are more expensive, time consuming, and are associated with a small but significant dose of radiation. Hence, CXR have become more widespread as a first line investigation. In this regard, the objective of this work is to develop a new deep transfer learning pipeline, named DenResCov-19, to diagnose patients with COVID-19, pneumonia, TB or healthy based on CXR images. The pipeline consists of the existing DenseNet-121 and the ResNet-50 networks. Since the DenseNet and ResNet have orthogonal performances in some instances, in the proposed model we have created an extra layer with convolutional neural network (CNN) blocks to join these two models together to establish superior performance as compared to the two individual networks. This strategy can be applied universally in cases where two competing networks are observed. We have tested the performance of our proposed network on two-class (pneumonia and healthy), three-class (COVID-19 positive, healthy, and pneumonia), as well as four-class (COVID-19 positive, healthy, TB, and pneumonia) classification problems. We have validated that our proposed network has been able to successfully classify these lung-diseases on our four datasets and this is one of our novel findings. In particular, the AUC-ROC are 99.60, 96.51, 93.70, 96.40% and the F1 values are 98.21, 87.29, 76.09, 83.17% on our Dataset X-Ray 1, 2, 3, and 4 (DXR1, DXR2, DXR3, DXR4), respectively.  2021 The Authors",Automatic classification; Chest X-rays; COVID-19; Deep transfer learning network; Pneumonia; Tuberculosis,Classification (of information); Computer aided diagnosis; Computerized tomography; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Diseases; Multilayer neural networks; Pipelines; Transfer learning; Well testing; Automatic classification; Chest X-ray; Coronavirus disease 2019; Coronaviruses; Deep transfer learning network; Learning network; Performance; Pneumonia; Transfer learning; Tuberculosis; Coronavirus; adult; area under the curve; Article; artificial intelligence; child; controlled study; convolutional neural network; coronavirus disease 2019; differential diagnosis; disease classification; human; lung tuberculosis; major clinical study; receiver operating characteristic; residual neural network; thorax radiography; transfer of learning; algorithm; diagnostic imaging; pneumonia; tuberculosis; X ray; Algorithms; COVID-19; Deep Learning; Humans; Pneumonia; SARS-CoV-2; Tuberculosis; X-Rays,"Mamalakis, M.; Department of Computer Science, United Kingdom; email: mmamalakis1@sheffield.ac.uk",NA,,,,,NA,,,,,No,,,"Mamalakis M., Swift A.J., Vorselaars B., Ray S., Weeks S., Ding W., Clayton R.H., Mackenzie L.S., Banerjee A.",,,fbb82802306e4c7f2be400bf184cd64c5cc2a8fd,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fbb82802306e4c7f2be400bf184cd64c5cc2a8fd,2021,2104.04006

Here we analysed the difference in kidney blood biomarkers in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients with non-fatal or fatal outcome, in order to develop a mortality prediction model for hospitalised SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. A retrospective cohort study including data from suspected SARS-CoV-2 positive patients admitted to a large National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust hospital in the Yorkshire and Humber regions, United Kingdom, between 1 March 2020 and 30 August 2020. Hospitalised adult patients (aged  18 years) with at least one confirmed positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 and blood tests of kidney biomarkers within 36 h of the RT-PCR test were included. The main outcome measure was 90-day in-hospital mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. The logistic regression and random forest (RF) models incorporated six predictors including three routine kidney function tests (sodium, urea; creatinine only in RF), along with age, sex, and ethnicity. The mortality prediction performance of the logistic regression model achieved an area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of 0.772 in the test dataset (95% CI: 0.6940.823), while the RF model attained the AUROC of 0.820 in the same test cohort (95% CI: 0.7400.870). The resulting validated prediction model is the first to focus on kidney biomarkers specifically on in-hospital mortality over a 90-day period.  2022 by the authors.

For patients undergoing cardiotoxic cancer therapy, ejection fraction assessment using radionuclide ventriculography (RNVG) is commonly used for serial assessment of left ventricular (LV) function. Methods: In this retrospective study, approximate entropy (ApEn), synchrony, entropy, and standard deviation from the phase histogram (phase SD) were investigated as potential early markers of LV dysfunction to predict CTRCD. These phase parameters were calculated from the baseline RNVG phase image for 177 breast cancer patients before commencing cardiotoxic therapy. Results: Of the 177 patients, 11 had a decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of over 10% to an LVEF below 50% after treatment had commenced. This patient group had a significantly higher ApEn at baseline to those who maintained a normal LVEF throughout treatment. Of the parameters investigated, ApEn was superior for predicting the risk of CTRCD. Combining ApEn with the baseline LVEF further improved the discrimination between the groups. Conclusions: The results suggest that RNVG phase analysis using approximate entropy may aid in the detection of sub-clinical LV contraction abnormalities, not detectable by baseline LVEF measurement, predicting a subsequent decline in LVEF.  2020, The Author(s).",diagnostic and prognostic application; dyssynchrony; image analysis; RNA: planar,"biological marker; pertechnetic acid tc 99m; pyrophosphate; adult; approximate entropy; Article; Bayesian learning; breast cancer; cancer therapy; cancer therapy related cardiac dysfunction; cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular risk; cross validation; data analysis; echocardiography; entropy; female; gait; heart disease; heart ejection fraction; heart left bundle branch block; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle size; heart ventricle function; histogram; human; image analysis; in vivo study; major clinical study; middle aged; radionuclide ventriculography; random forest; retrospective study; software; texture analysis; breast tumor; cardiotoxicity; diagnostic imaging; heart disease; heart left ventricle function; heart stroke volume; radionuclide ventriculography; risk assessment; Breast Neoplasms; Cardiotoxicity; Female; Heart Diseases; Humans; Radionuclide Ventriculography; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Stroke Volume; Ventricular Dysfunction, Left; Ventricular Function, Left","Jones, K.A.; Department of Nuclear Cardiology, United Kingdom; email: k.jones.3@research.gla.ac.uk",NA,Springer,10713581,,JNCAE,32748278,English,J.

MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom; MacLean, O.A., MRC-Universi","Vaccines based on the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 are a cornerstone of the public health response to COVID-19. The emergence of hypermutated, increasingly transmissible variants of concern (VOCs) threaten this strategy. Omicron (B.1.1.529), the fifth VOC to be described, harbours multiple amino acid mutations in spike, half of which lie within the receptor-binding domain. Here we demonstrate substantial evasion of neutralization by Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants in vitro using sera from individuals vaccinated with ChAdOx1, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273. These data were mirrored by a substantial reduction in real-world vaccine effectiveness that was partially restored by booster vaccination. The Omicron variants BA.1 and BA.2 did not induce cell syncytia in vitro and favoured a TMPRSS2-independent endosomal entry pathway, these phenotypes mapping to distinct regions of the spike protein. Impaired cell fusion was determined by the receptor-binding domain, while endosomal entry mapped to the S2 domain. Such marked changes in antigenicity and replicative biology may underlie the rapid global spread and altered pathogenicity of the Omicron variant.  2022, The Author(s).",,"coronavirus spike

Mathematical and statistical modelling provided critical information on the spread of the virus and the potential impact of different interventions. The unprecedented scale of the challenge led the epidemiological modelling community in the UK to be pushed to its limits. At the same time, mathematical modellers across the country were keen to use their knowledge and skills to support the COVID-19 modelling effort. However, this sudden great interest in epidemiological modelling needed to be coordinated to provide much-needed support, and to limit the burden on epidemiological modellers already very stretched for time. In this paper we describe three initiatives set up in the UK in spring 2020 to coordinate the mathematical sciences research community in supporting mathematical modelling of COVID-19. Each initiative had different primary aims and worked to maximise synergies between the various projects. We reflect on the lessons learnt, highlighting the key roles of pre-existing research collaborations and focal centres of coordination in contributing to the success of these initiatives. We conclude with recommendations about important ways in which the scientific research community could be better prepared for future pandemics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",,2-s2.0-85141954356,,https://api.newton.ac.uk/website/v0/events/preprints/NI20017,,ebdf57a518d9d4ec83458e4746d4866e9cb59d1d,,,

Here we presented a simplified risk-tool based on minimal parameters and chest X-ray (CXR) image data that predicts the survival of adult SARS-CoV-2 positive patients at hospital admission. We analysed the NCCID database of patient blood variables and CXR images from 19 hospitals across the UK using multivariable logistic regression. The initial dataset was non-randomly split between development and internal validation dataset with 1434 and 310 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, respectively. External validation of the final model was conducted on 741 Accident and Emergency (A&E) admissions with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection from a separate NHS Trust. The LUCAS mortality score included five strongest predictors (Lymphocyte count, Urea, C-reactive protein, Age, Sex), which are available at any point of care with rapid turnaround of results. Our simple multivariable logistic model showed high discrimination for fatal outcome with the area under the receiving operating characteristics curve (AUC-ROC) in development cohort 0.765 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.738-0.790), in internal validation cohort 0.744 (CI: 0.673-0.808), and in external validation cohort 0.752 (CI: 0.713-0.787). The discriminatory power of LUCAS increased slightly when including the CXR image data. LUCAS can be used to obtain valid predictions of mortality in patients within 60 days of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results into low, moderate, high, or very high risk of fatality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",,,,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.27.21256196v1.full.pdf,,5eb1736b58bbd974ee188db478bf71510aa50e26,,,
Adeno-associated virus 2 infection in children with non-A-E hepatitis,"Ho, Antonia et al.",,2023,Nature,,,,,,,,10.1038/s41586-023-05948-2,,,,"An outbreak of acute hepatitis of unknown aetiology in children was reported in Scotland in April 20221 and has now been identified in 35 countries2. Several recent studies have suggested an association with human adenovirus (HAdV), a virus not commonly associated with hepatitis. Here we report a detailed case-control investigation and find an association between adeno-associated virus (AAV2) infection and host genetics in disease susceptibility. Using next-generation sequencing (NGS), reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), serology and in situ hybridisation (ISH), we detected recent infection with AAV2 in the plasma and liver samples of 26/32 (81%) hepatitis cases versus 5/74 (7%) of controls. Further, AAV2 was detected within ballooned hepatocytes alongside a prominent T cell infiltrate in liver biopsies. In keeping with a CD4+ T-cell-mediated immune pathology, the Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) class II DRB1*04:01 allele was identified in 25/27 cases (93%), compared with a background frequency of 10/64 (16%; p=5.49 x 10-12). In summary, we report an outbreak of acute paediatric hepatitis associated with AAV2 infection (most likely acquired as a coinfection with HAdV which is required as a helper virus to support AAV2 replication) and HLA class II-related disease susceptibility.",,,,,,,,,36996873,,,,,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",,,,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.19.22277425v1.full.pdf,,78ed4820d7f2cce2f2fb2846a22457a637ec1a9e,,,
"Probabilistic Modelling of Water Quality in the Ramganga River, India, Informed by Sparce Observational Data","Glendell, Miriam; Sinha, Rajiv; Choudhary, Bharat; Singh, Manudeo; Ray, Surajit",,2023,EGU Meetings,,,,,,,,10.5194/egusphere-egu23-7990,,,,"Impaired water quality continues to be a serious problem in surface waters worldwide. Despite extensive regulatory water quality monitoring implemented by the Government of India over the past two decades, the spatial and temporal resolution of water quality observations, the range of monitored contaminants and data related to characterisation of point source effluents are still limited. In addition, discharge data for trans-boundary rivers is considered sensitive information and is not publicly available. Hence, quantifying, and mitigating pollutant loads and planning effective mitigation strategies are hindered by data paucity and there is an urgent need for the development of decision support tools (DST) that can account for these uncertainties.

In this study, we tested the application of a probabilistic DST based on Bayesian Belief Networks, to evaluate pollution risk from nutrients (phosphate, nitrate, ammonia), sediments and heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Zn) in the Ramganga river basin (30,839 km2), the first major tributary of the Ganga in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India, and is understood to be a significant source of pollution into the Ganga River, contributed from a range of industries, domestic sources and intensive farming practices. Bayesian belief networks are graphical causal models that enable to integrate observational data (both spatial and temporal) with data from literature and expert knowledge within a probabilistic framework, whilst accounting for uncertainty.

The objectives of this study were to 1) develop a parsimonious conceptual model of the system that allows harnessing diverse but limited data, 2) evaluate the important components of the system to inform further data collection and management strategies, and 3) simulate plausible management scenarios. We simulated the impacts of point source management interventions on pollution risk, including provision of sufficient municipal sewage treatment plant (STP) capacity, enhanced STP treatment levels and sufficient industrial wastewater effluent treatment capacity. We found a clear effect of enhanced STP interventions on improved regulatory standard compliance for nitrate (from 92% to 95%) and phosphate (from 33% to 41%). However, the effect of interventions on heavy metal pollution risk was not clear, due to considerable uncertainties related to the lack of reliable discharge data and the characterisation of industrial effluent quality. The parsimonious DST helped to collate the available understanding related to water quality impacts from multiple pollutants in the Ramganga river basin, while sensitivity analysis highlighted critical areas for further data collection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To provide new spatiotemporal constraints on river chemistry, dissolved trace element concentrations were measured at 17 targeted locations across the Ramganga River catchment. River water samples were collected across three seasons: pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon between 2019 and 2021. To remove the dependency of trace element concentrations on discharge, we used molar ratios, as discharge data on Indian transboundary rivers are not publicly available. The dataset reveals significant spatiotemporal variability in dissolved trace element concentrations of the Ramganga River. Samples collected upstream of Moradabad, a major industrial city in western Uttar Pradesh, are characterized by ~ 1.22.5 times higher average concentrations of most of the trace elements except Sc, V, Cr, Rb, and Pb, likely due to intense waterrock interactions in the headwaters. Such kind of enrichment in trace metal concentrations was also observed at sites downstream of large cities and industrial centers. However, such enrichment was not enough to bring a major change in the River Ganga chemistry, as the signals got diluted downstream of the Ramganga-Ganga confluence. The average river water composition of the Ramganga River was comparable to worldwide river water composition, albeit a few sites were characterized by very high concentrations of dissolved trace elements. Finally, we provide an outlook that calls for an assessment of stable non-traditional isotopes that are ideally suited to track the origin and transformation of elements such as Li, Mg, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, Ag, Cd, Sn, Pt, and Hg in Indian rivers.  2023, The Author(s).",Ganga rivers; Human impact; Metal pollution; Ramganga River; River geochemistry,Atmospheric thermodynamics; Catchments; Dissolution; Geochemistry; Molar ratio; River pollution; Trace elements; Down-stream; Ganga river; Human impact; Metal pollution; Ramgangum river; River geochemistries; River water; Trace elements concentration; Traces elements; Water composition; Rivers; anthropogenic source; concentration (composition); dissolved matter; industrial location; pollutant source; river pollution; river water; spatiotemporal analysis; trace element; urban area; water quality; India; Ramganga River; fresh water; trace element; water; environmental monitoring; India; river; Environmental Monitoring; Fresh Water; India; Rivers; Trace Elements; Water,,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,1676369,,EMASD,37668950,English,Environ.

Methods: A retrospective cohort analysis in the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHS GGC) Health Board. All sequenced non-nosocomial adult COVID-19 cases in NHS GGC with relevant SARS-CoV-2 lineages (B.1.177/Alpha, Alpha/Delta, AY.4.2 Delta/non-AY.4.2 Delta, non-AY.4.2 Delta/Omicron, and BA.1 Omicron/BA.2 Omicron) during analysis periods were included. Outcome measures were hospital admission, ICU admission, or death within 28 days of positive COVID-19 test. We report the cumulative odds ratio; the ratio of the odds that an individual experiences a severity event of a given level vs all lower severity levels for the resident and the replacement variant after adjustment. Results: After adjustment for covariates, the cumulative odds ratio was 1.51 (95% CI: 1.082.11) for Alpha versus B.1.177, 2.09 (95% CI: 1.423.08) for Delta versus Alpha, 0.99 (95% CI: 0.761.27) for AY.4.2 Delta versus non-AY.4.2 Delta, 0.49 (95% CI: 0.221.06) for Omicron versus non-AY.4.2 Delta, and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.681.09) for BA.2 Omicron versus BA.1 Omicron. Conclusions: The direction of change in intrinsic severity between successively emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants was inconsistent, reminding us that the intrinsic severity of future SARS-CoV-2 variants remains uncertain.  2023",Alpha variant; COVID-19; Delta variant; Intrinsic severity; Omicron variant; SARS-CoV-2,adult; Article; cohort analysis; coronavirus disease 2019; death; disease severity; gene sequence; hospital admission; human; intensive care unit; outcome assessment; pandemic; personal experience; retrospective study; SARS-CoV-2 (lineage B.1.177); SARS-CoV-2 (lineage BA.1); SARS-CoV-2 (lineage BA.2); SARS-CoV-2 Alpha; SARS-CoV-2 Delta; SARS-CoV-2 Omicron; virus strain; genetics; hospitalization; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Adult; COVID-19; Hospitalization; Humans; Retrospective Studies; SARS-CoV-2; SARS-CoV-2 variants,"Thomson, E.C.; MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR)United Kingdom; email: emma.thomson@glasgow.ac.uk",,W.B.

However, none have addressed the impact on maximum severity of illness in the general population classified by the level of respiratory support required, or death. We aimed to do this. Methods In this retrospective multi-centre clinical cohort sub-study of the COG-UK consortium, 1475 samples from Scottish hospitalised and community cases collected between 1st November 2020 and 30th January 2021 were sequenced. We matched sequence data to clinical outcomes as the Alpha variant became dominant in Scotland and modelled the association between Alpha variant infection and severe disease using a 4-point scale of maximum severity by 28 days: 1. no respiratory support, 2. supplemental oxygen, 3. ventilation and 4. death. Results Our cumulative generalised linear mixed model analyses found evidence (cumulative odds ratio: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.93) of a positive association between increased clinical severity and lineage (Alpha variant versus pre-Alpha variants). Conclusions The Alpha variant was associated with more severe clinical disease in the Scottish population than co-circulating lineages. :  2023 Pascall et al.",,adult; aged; Article; bioinformatics; child; cohort analysis; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; female; genomics; high flow nasal cannula therapy; high throughput sequencing; hospitalization; human; immunosuppressive treatment; infant; intensive care unit; length of stay; male; middle aged; newborn; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; retrospective study; SARS-CoV-2 Alpha; Scotland; sequence alignment; very elderly; whole genome sequencing; clinical trial; epidemiology; genetics; genomics; multicenter study; COVID-19; Genomics; Humans; Retrospective Studies; SARS-CoV-2; Scotland,"Thomson, E.C.; MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR)United Kingdom; email: emma.thomson@glasgow.ac.uk",,Public Library of Science,19326203,,POLNC,37053201,English,PLoS ONE,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85152598538,,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10153356/1/s41564-022-01143-7.pdf,,,,,
